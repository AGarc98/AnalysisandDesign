# Analysis and Design

1. The problem I looked at in this course was how best to implement an object in c++ to hold data.
2. I addressed this problem by considering the run time complexity of using different data structures.
3. I encountered a few problems trying to read the file with the courses, but was able to overcome it by looking at what other people had done for similar problems.
4. The work on this project has definitely made me consider what is optimal for one situation is not nessecarily optimal for all situations.
5. I have also learned that it is very important to write shorter but still useful comments when writing code that is readable
